**Welcome to JS Bites!** I just wanted to briefly explain what this blog is about.

With the increasing amount of information on the internet, people are becoming more overwhelmed with consuming information.
I don't know about you, but I have a very long list of podcasts and articles that build up throughout the day.
And it's stressful because I feel the need to listen to and read all of them.

It get's even more stressful when I see a podcast that is 3 hours long or an article that is a 20-minute read.
The reason I listen to podcasts and read articles is that they can be done quickly whenever I get a free second.

But I'm seeing more and more that the media I'm consuming is increasing in length.
I'm not sure if it's because authors think that they need to hit a certain length in order to be considered useful?

Whatever it is this blog is meant to be the opposite of that. Each post is going to be little bites of Javascript wisdom.

I promise that each article will be succinct, straight to the point, and take no longer than 3 minutes to read.

Thanks for reading and I hope that you will get little **JS Bites** of goodness from this blog.
