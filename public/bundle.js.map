From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./salty_egg.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chinese Salty Egg\\\"></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 546 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"My Second Post!\",\"date\":\"2015-05-06T23:46:37.121Z\",\"readNext\":\"/hi-folks/\",\"path\":\"/my-second-post/\",\"body\":\"<p>Wow!
